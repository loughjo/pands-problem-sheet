Description of Program : a program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains.

I checked out teh following w3shools link to see how to use the open() function.<br />
https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_open.asp

askubuntu.com was useful in how to input the filename moby-dick.txt as an argument in teh commandline.<br />
https://askubuntu.com/questions/1059579/input-the-filename-in-the-commandline-as-an-argument-in-python



**Assumptions :**
1) I assume that we only need to count lowercase 'e'. 
   If I were to count Uppercase 'E' I would need => if char == "e" or char == "E":
2) We just need to print out the count of the letter 'e', no need to print any other text.
